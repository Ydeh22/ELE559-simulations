    "At the scale of an entire chip, full electromagnetic simulations become prohibitive. To gain insight on the behaviour of an entire circuit, circuit simulations using **compact models** can instead be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the semiconductor industry, a compact model is a \"computationally efficient description of the terminal properties of a device as a function of terminal voltages\" [(Sivakumar Mudanai (Intel), on Nanohub)](https://nanohub.org/resources/21459/download/2014.06.10-Mudanai-NEEDS.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize the concept to photonics : a compact model would be an efficient description of the properties of a device as a function of a few parameters such as wavelength, voltage applied, etc. The properties we are most often interested in are the S-parameters, the elements of the scattering matrix. The concept originated in microwave design, so a good introduction is contained in Ch. 4.3 of [1]. As usual, the main reference for the class [2] has a good chapter on it (Ch. 9).\n",
