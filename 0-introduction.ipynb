    "* **MPB : MIT Periodic Bands**\n",
    "    * \"MPB computes definite-frequency eigenstates, or harmonic modes, of Maxwell's equations in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary wavevectors, using fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is applicable to many problems in optics, such as waveguides and resonator systems, and photonic crystals. [1]\n",

    "* **MEEP : MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation**\n",
    "    * \"A time-domain electromagnetic simulation simply evolves Maxwell's equations over time within some finite computational volume, essentially performing a kind of numerical experiment. This can be used to calculate a wide variety of useful quantities. Major applications include:\n",
    "        * Transmittance and Reflectance Spectra — by Fourier-transforming the response to a short pulse, a single simulation can yield the scattering amplitudes over a broadband spectrum.\n",
    "        * Resonant Modes and Frequencies — by analyzing the response of the system to a short pulse, one can extract the frequencies, decay rates, and field patterns of the harmonic modes of lossy and lossless systems including waveguide and cavity modes.\n",
